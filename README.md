# Welcome to my Data Analysis repository! 
#### Here you will find what I've been working on, regarding Data and Development Policies.
#### When I first started I couldn't help my self coding just for the fun of integers, so I began using public data sets to practice my coding skills. Eventually, I realized that Development Policies and Statistics were rocking my world, and R was giving me the tools to dive into it like a true scuba diver. Using ggplot, tidyverse, dplyr, and several packages more I was able to analyse the data and draw graphics that enhanced the interpretation of the data through visualization.

## Today I'll show what I'm working on :)
