# Welcome to my Data Analysis repository! 

#### When I first started, I couldn't help my self coding just for the fun of integers.

#### But eventually, I began using public data sets to practice my coding skills and that was it. 
#### I realized that Development Policies and Statistics were rocking my world, and R was giving me the tools to dive into it like a real scuba diver. Using ggplot, tidyverse, dplyr, and several packages more, I've been able to analyze the data and make it into graphics and visual presentations to enhance interpretation. Understanding causal effects that otherwise, would have seem counterintuitive.

### Here you will find what I am currently working on with R :)
