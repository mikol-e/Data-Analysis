# Welcome to my Data Analysis repository! 

#### When I first started, I couldn't help my self coding just for the fun of integers.

#### So I began using public data sets to practice my coding skills. 
#### Eventually, I realized that Development Policies and Statistics were rocking my world, and R was giving me the tools to dive into it like a real scuba diver. Using ggplot, tidyverse, dplyr, and several more packages I had been able to analyse the data and draw graphics from it to enhance interpretation.

### Here you will find what I am currently working on :)
